## LittleBerry Library Management Database

This is a client-side SPA for LittleBerryLibrary, a cloud based database for small and mid-sized libraries.
The system is written in AngularJS and links to an API server which stores the data in a MS Sql database.  
The images are stored on Amazon S3

## The Database

THe database itself is extremely simple.  It consists of a book table, members table and a request table.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Simply copy the files to the root of an public directory.  It's excusively client-side, so it can be on just about any service. 
The configiuration file /app/config.ts   will have all the codes necessary to access the server.  If you have no account, you'll have to contact 
LittleBerryLibrary and get one.

## API Reference
