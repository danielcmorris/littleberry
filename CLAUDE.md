# Site Structure
- The front end of the system is running on .200 machine in a docker container
- The API server is on the snapdragon server and the code is at C:\Users\dmorr\source\repos\PFSA API
    - the code needs to be run under windows.  it won't compile in wsl
- The Database is on the snapdragon server and is called 'LittleBerry'

# Repository
- [git.morrisdev.com  littleberry](https://git.morrisdev.com/dmorris/littleberry)
    - this is also where the docker containers are  https://git.morrisdev.com/-/admin/packages

# Plans

This needs to be converted to Angular 20+, made to look nice and the back-end api should be converted to dotnet core and the db should be moved to postgres
